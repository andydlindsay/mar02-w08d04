### To Do
- [x] Review ES6 Classes
- [x] Intro to Class-based Components
- [x] Passing Props
- [x] Handling Events and Changes to State
- [x] Lifecycle Methods

### Objects
- `new` whole new object
- declare with const 
- live as long as we want

### Functions
- create/destroy their internal state on every invocation

```js
let i = 0;
const sayHello = (name) => {
  const str = `hello ${name}`;
  const isAlsoHere = true;
  const message = 'hello world';
  i = i + 1;
};
```
